final assignment 

1.Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes.
Challenge: Responsive Design
Ensuring a seamless experience across devices posed a challenge, but Bootstrap's responsive grid system provided a robust solution. Testing and iterating on various screen sizes helped fine-tune the responsiveness.

Challenge: Performance Optimization
Large image files could impact page load times. Addressing this, I compressed images without compromising quality and employed lazy loading to enhance performance.


 2.What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?" 
 Creating this portfolio has been a rewarding experience that has combined technical skills with creativity. The approach not only showed my photography but also provided as a learning opportunity for me. I'm thrilled to be able to share my work with the world and look forward to expanding this portfolio as my photography journey continues.
